You are tasked with implementing **Web Frontend v0.2** for my project.
The detailed requirements are described in the file:
`vibe/v0.2/prd-v0.2.md`

**Your task**:

* Read and understand all requirements from the PRD.
* Implement the frontend solution accordingly.
* You may choose the most appropriate programming language, libraries, and frameworks for the task (web frontend context).
* The implementation **must** respect modularity and follow **industry best practices** for maintainable, high-quality code.
* The code should be clean, well-documented, and structured so that it can be extended easily in future versions.

**General coding rules (apply to any language):**

1. Write clear, concise, and consistent documentation for all functions, classes, and modules.
2. Keep methods/functions short and focused on a single responsibility.
3. Use meaningful and descriptive naming for variables, methods, and classes.
4. Follow standard linting/style rules for the chosen language or framework.
5. Ensure that the architecture separates concerns (UI logic, state management, API communication, etc.).
6. Avoid duplication â€” extract reusable components and helpers where appropriate.
7. Ensure accessibility and responsiveness in the UI where applicable.
8. Include error handling and graceful degradation for all user interactions and API calls.
9. Organize the project structure logically (e.g., separate folders for components, assets, utilities, tests).
10. Include inline comments for non-trivial code segments explaining the reasoning.

**Quality expectations:**

* Code should be **modular** and **maintainable**.
* All chosen frameworks/libraries should be well-supported and stable.
* The implementation should be **testable**, with functions/components designed for easy unit or integration testing.
* Follow best practices for performance in the chosen framework.

When generating the code:

* Clearly separate frontend presentation from application logic.
* Implement only the functionality defined in v0.2 (do not implement future features).
* Use placeholder or mock logic only where explicitly indicated in the PRD.

More generally, follow the rules defined in `rules.json` at the root of the project.
